Actions
=======

Whenever something happens, what happens, are actions!

Actions are usually not alone, the is usually some list that has actions
in a certain order to be executed.

How they work
-------------

.. figure:: actions_list.png
   :alt: 

When you are offered to list actions, it means something happened,
perhaps the player interacted with a Chara or an Event ("clicked"),
perhaps he used an item, or something else. The list of actions is a
recipe of what will happen.

Clicking Add Action with no action selected will insert the new action
after the current list of actions. If any action is selected, clicking
Add Action will insert the new action above the selected action.

Actions are read from top to bottom, they are then placed in a FIFO
buffer. The IF action can interact with this buffer, which will change
execution flow.

A list of actions will have the following format:

::

    [["actionName","PARAM1;PARAM2;..."],
     ["actionName","PARAM1;PARAM2;..."],
     ...
     ["actionName","PARAM1;PARAM2;..."]]

An example of a list of actions:

::

    [["showText","Got a sword!"],
     ["addItem","sword"]]

The interface will provide a clean and easy way to create, edit, reorder
and remove actions.

Available Actions
-----------------

|image0| showText
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "text"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/showText.png
   :alt: 

**showText** presents a text to the player and blocks, waiting for him
to interact. Currently it supports text wrapping and shows a word per
time, and plays a small noise for each word.

This is a very important part that can be a lot more complex than it
seems, like supporting multiple sounds, characters for pausing, auto
skipping text and all, which can give each conversation bigger depth.
Right now, though, I have no idea how to implement everything in a nice
way.

|image1| alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "text"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/alert.png
   :alt: 

**alert** is a way to show quick texts, that doesn't require the player
to interact.

|image2| teleport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"positionx", "positiony", "level"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/teleport.png
   :alt: 

**teleport** enables moving in a single frame the player from anywhere
in the screen to a defined position at a defined level and it's usually
meant to be used in doors in a dungeon or town.

|image3| teleportInPlace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "level"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/teleportInPlace.png
   :alt: 

**teleportInPlace** enables moving in a single frame the player from a
map to another map, preserving the player exact position.

|image4| addItem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "item"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/addItem.png
   :alt: 

**addItem** adds an item to the player inventory.

|image5| dropItem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "item"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/dropItem.png
   :alt: 

**dropItem** drops one item from the player inventory.

|image6| changeTile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"tileType","layer","colision","event",["positionx","positiony","level"]/["current"]

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/changeTile.png
   :alt: 

**changeTile** can change a tile from a type, to any other type and also
change that tile event mark and remove or add colision. It can also
target a specific position in a level or just the current tile that
contains the event. It's a very powerful action and adds a lot of
possibilities.

|image7| changeAllTiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "tileType", "tileType", "layer", "colision", "event", "level"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/changeAllTiles.png
   :alt: 

**changeAllTiles** changes a single tile that has a type the chosen
layer, for another tile of different type. You can also set those tiles
to a different value of colision or event number.

|image8| changePlayerAnimation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: "charaset\_animation"

**changePlayerAnimation** changes the current player animation. You can
set to default to let animations flow as usual.

|image9| rain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"start/stop"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/rain.png
   :alt: 

**rain** makes rain. You can stop the rain using stop.

|image10| shakeScreen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"horizontalorvertical"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/shakeScreen.png
   :alt: 

**shakeScreen** shakes the screen. Also blocks the actions for a short
period. You can choose between shaking vertical or horizontal direction.

|image11| fadeOut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"effect", "keepEffect"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/fadeOut.png
   :alt: 

**fadeOut** fades the screen using a effect and can optionally keep that
effect, usually when you want to do something in between and then play a
fadeIn.

|image12| fadeIn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"effect", "keepEffect"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/fadeIn.png
   :alt: 

**fadeIn** is similar to fadeOut, but instead it's meant to bring the
screen back from a fadeOut.

|image13| playMusic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"musicname"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/playMusic.png
   :alt: 

**playMusic** play a music from the folder ``audio/music``.

|image14| playSound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"soundname"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/playSound.png
   :alt: 

**playSound** play a sound from the folder ``audio/``.

|image15| setVar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"variable","value"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/setVar.png
   :alt: 

**setVar** allow to change a Variable to a specific value. Value can be
a number, a string or a *special string*.

Right now the only supported *special string* is "var:varname", where
varname should be changed to the name of a variable which the value you
want to pass to the Variable - the first parameter.

|image16| varPlusOne
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"variable"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/varPlusOne.png
   :alt: 

**varPlusOne** sums integer 1 on variable (var).

If variable doesn't exist, it creates it!

|image17| waitCycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"int"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/waitCycle.png
   :alt: 

**waitCycle** blocks the player for a number of specified cycles.

|image18| IF
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:"condition"

.. figure:: actions/screenshots/IF.png
   :alt: 

**IF** condition is a special type of parameter, right now it must be in
the format ``"varOrValue1;oper;varOrValue2"``, where ``oper`` is the
operator.

Possible operators:

-  ``>``,\ ``bigger``,\ ``greater`` : returns ``true`` if
   ``varOrValue1`` is bigger than ``varOrValue2``.

-  ``<``,\ ``smaller``,\ ``less`` : returns ``true`` if ``varOrValue1``
   is smaller than ``varOrValue2``.

-  ``>=`` : returns ``true`` if ``varOrValue1`` is bigger than or equal
   to ``varOrValue2``.

-  ``<=`` : returns ``true`` if ``varOrValue1`` is smaller than or equal
   to ``varOrValue2``.

-  ``==``,\ ``=``,\ ``equal`` : returns ``true`` if ``varOrValue1`` is
   equal to ``varOrValue2``. Works with non numeric values too.

The field **var of value** can be either a value (like ``1``, ``42`` or
``house``), or a variable. If it's a variable, the following variables
available:

-  ``var:varname``, where ``varname`` is the name of a user defined
   variable.

-  ``ans:``, is the answer of the last questionBox, as text.

-  ``ans:num``, the number of the answer of the last questionBox. First
   answer is ``0``.

-  ``lastbattle:``, return True if the player won the last battle.

-  ``hero:face``, returns on of the following directions
   ``up``,\ ``down``,\ ``left``, ``right``.

-  ``hero:x``, returns the x position of the Hero in the map.

-  ``hero:y``, returns the y position of the Hero in the map.

-  ``map:this``, returns the name of the current map.

If the condition is met, this is, it evaluates to TRUE, then it runs
whatever code is next until ELSE or END action are met, and jumps to
after the END. If the condition is FALSE then it ignores any actions
until ELSE or END.

An example below of a possible use of IF in a magical item that takes
you between two maps:

::

    [["IF","map:this;equal;darkworld"],
     ["teleportInPlace","lightworld"],
     ["ELSE",""],
     ["teleportInPlace","darkworld"],
     ["END"]]

|image19| ELSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: ""

**ELSE** is to be used with IF action.

|image20| END
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter: ""

**END** is to be used with IF action.

|image21| noEffect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No parameter

This a placeholder, but it's meant to turn off all effects, like the
ones from fadeIn and fadeOut.
